        "*   A sample dataset of 6 customer reviews with corresponding 'Positive', 'Negative', and 'Neutral' sentiment labels was successfully prepared.\n",
        "*   In the simulated environment, all three prompting techniques (zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot) achieved 100% accuracy in classifying the 6 sample reviews against their true labels.\n",
        "*   The simulation logic for each prompting technique relied on simple keyword matching, which deterministically classified the crafted sample reviews correctly.\n",
        "*   The one-shot prompt included one labeled example, and the few-shot prompt included three labeled examples, which implicitly guided the simulated LLM's understanding of the expected output format and classification patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Accuracy, Clarity, and Consistency**: While the simulated performance showed perfect accuracy across all techniques for the small, keyword-driven dataset, this result is not representative of real-world LLM behavior. In practice, few-shot prompting typically enhances clarity and consistency by providing explicit examples, allowing the model to better understand the task's nuances and desired output format, leading to improved accuracy over zero-shot and one-shot methods, especially for complex tasks or domain-specific language.\n",
        "*   **Theoretical Benefits of Few-shot Prompting**: Few-shot prompting leverages in-context learning, enabling LLMs to adapt to new tasks without extensive fine-tuning. The multiple examples provide the model with a more robust understanding of the input-output mapping, improving its ability to generalize and make more accurate and consistent predictions on unseen data, which is a significant advantage over methods that offer little to no in-context guidance.\n",
        "*   **Next Steps for Realistic Evaluation**: To genuinely compare the performance of these prompting techniques, the next step should involve evaluating them using actual Large Language Models (LLMs) (e.g., through an API) on a larger, more diverse, and less keyword-centric dataset. This would provide a more realistic assessment of their respective accuracy, consistency, and the practical benefits of in-context learning.\n"
